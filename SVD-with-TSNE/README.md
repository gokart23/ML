#Singular Value Decomposition and Visualization using TSNE

- ### Dataset ###: We used a cleaned version of the Large Text Compression corpus (can be found [here](http://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip))
- ### SVD ###: Singular Vector Decomposition of the 10k most frequent words of the dataset was performed, and the corresponding word embeddings chosen by truncating the SVD representation to 50 dimensions
- ### t-SNE ###: t-SNE representation was performed using 2 components, and the resultant vectors visualized
- ### Code ###: Code for SVD can be found in `svd.py` and t-SNE code can be found in the iPython notebook `tsne.ipynb`
